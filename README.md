## How to get started 
1. Make sure you're a member of the discord server to get tasks. 
2. Fork the repository to your github account so you have a copy of it that you can make changes to. 
3. Clone the repository that you just forked, it should be at located github.com/your_username/Daily-Tasks .
4. Create a main folder with your username e.g Rayhatron 
    - Then a sub folder inside the main one named after the category of the task you're working on e.g "UI - UX Tasks"
    - Lastly create another folder with the name of the task inside the category based folder e.g "01- Sign up form"
5. Work on your task in the appropriate folder. 
6. Push your changes to the repository on your account. 
7. Create a pull request to submit your task for feedback. 
8. Repeat steps 4 - 7 as appropriate. 
9. Become a rockstar developer :) 

**NOTE:** Do not delete any folders in the repository that you have forked and cloned. Just ignore them and work in the main folder named after you.
